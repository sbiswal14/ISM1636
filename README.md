## ISM1636

### Introduction:
My name is Subash chandra Biswal (U77884251) and this repository is for Data Science Programming class with Professor Dr. Smith. The class comprises of quiet a good amount of handson coding assignments, weekly assignments, quizzes and in-class practice assignments. Th class covers many machine learning models for classification and regresiion. 

### About the repository:
The repository is arranged hierarchically in which one folder is created for each week of class which has all the study materials and assignment folder. Each assignment folder has both data file and code files.

The folders cover topics as mentioned below.

### Assignments: ( Mini Projects)
There are three assignments which are like mini projects implementing knowledge from couple of weeks.

- $Assignment 1 :$
  The assignment was to analyse the cardiotocography data and classify each observation as suspect or normal.

  2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert  obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.

- $Assignment 2 :$
  Thenassignment was an enhancement of assignment 1 using neural network and comparing the predictions with normal classification models (Decision tree.)
  
  The code to fit neural network models and the comparision of performance can be found [here.](https://github.com/sbiswal14/ISM1636/blob/main/W08/Assignment/modelfit_cardio.ipynb)
  
- $Assignment 3 :$
  This assignment was on implementing Recurring Neural Network to process multivariate data to predict the time series data on traffic volume and predict.
  
  Hourly Interstate 94 Westbound traffic volume for MN DoT ATR station 301, roughly midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN. Hourly weather features and holidays  included for impacts on traffic volume.

  Attribute Information:

  - holiday : Categorical US National holidays plus regional holiday, Minnesota State Fair
  - temp : Numeric Average temp in kelvin
  - rain_1h : Numeric Amount in mm of rain that occurred in the hour
  - snow_1h : Numeric Amount in mm of snow that occurred in the hour
  - clouds_all : Numeric Percentage of cloud cover
